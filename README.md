Cryptocurrencies

This challenge addressed the grouping of cryptocurrencies for the development of an investment product.  Because there were no known output before starting the project, an unsupervised learning model was created.  Actions taken to complete the project included:  preprocessing data, reducing data dimensions using PCA, and clustering cryptocurrencies using K-means.  Finally, findings were visualized with a 3D scatter plot.
